# SuperUserBugReporter
This is the bug reporter for our video game for Business Professionals of America.

One of the requirements for the game is to have a way the end user can generate a crash report when the game crashes.
With this crash reporter, the user can freely vent or describe what they were doing prior to the time of the crash.
At the current moment, this crash reporter emails the developers (us) and the bug submitter a copy of the crash report.
